This project is broken up into a backend and frontend. The backend contains the Django project which uses the Django Rest Framework to host a simple API. The frontend uses React and queries data from the API. The backend is found in the django apps: api and vbbportal. The frontend is a react app, and most of the code is located in the src folder.

Run the following commands inside of the repository folder to get started:

```json
virtualenv env
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm i 
npm run build
python manage.py runserver
```

These commands (respectively)
1. virtualenv env (create a virual environment for all of your python packages)
2. pip install -r requirements.txt (install all of the python packages listed in requirements.txt)
3. npm i (install the node_js modules) (node js needs to be installed on your computer first)
4. npm run build (this will create a static build file so that django can host the react app)
5. python manage.py runserver (this will run your server locally)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
